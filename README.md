# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview 

The purpose of this project was to help the owner of a ride-share company to determine the ride-sharing data 
by city type ( Urban, Suburban and Rural). To execute this, I analyzed three key parameters: Total Rides,
Total Drivers and Total Fares by each city type to determine the total weekly fares for each city type.


# Results 
The results of the analysis shows that the Rural city type had the overall least total rides(125),
total drivers(780), total fares($4,327.93), ad highest average fare per ride ( $34.62) and average fare per
driver($55.49). The Urban city type had the overall highest total rides(1,625),total drivers(2,405), total
fares($39,854.38), the lowest average fare per ride ($24.54) and average fare per driver($16.57). The suburban
city type fell somwhere in the middle as illustrated by (https://github.com/dernae/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig10.png).
To determine the weekly performance by citytype, we took a snippet of the dataset and orieted it into a multi-line line chart (https://github.com/dernae/PyBer_Analysis/blob/master/analysis/Fig8.png)


# Summary

Based on the results of the analysis, I recommend that the CEO recruits more drivers for the rural areas to aid 
the disparities in the average fare per ride and the average fare per drivers that is higher in the rural areas. 
The month of February seems to be an opportune period for more drivers in the suburban city type. The CEO 
should consider raising the fare prices to generate more revenue for the drivers. The month of April into May 
shows a dip in the fares for the Urban city type, The CEO should consider lowering the fare prices to enocourage 
riders to take more trips.
